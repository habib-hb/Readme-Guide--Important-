Project: React-Laravel Ecommerce,

->next_ecommerce_backend is the LocalVersion backend of this project. 'next_ecommerce_backend - deployVersion' contains the same files but database connections and redirect routes being changed for the Hosting server Cpanel. On Cpanel, the backend is stored on the folder/domain called - "laravel.valueadderhabib.com". 

-> E-commerce-next(ReactVersion) contains the frontend of this project. 'my-react-app' contains the updated localVersion. 'my-react-app - Backup' contains the backup files which is often not up to date. 'my-react-app - deployVersion' contains the updated deployVersion of the project. It contains the react files and also the build output (dist). It has the links and redirects updated for the backend stored on the Hosting Server's cpanel (laravel.valueadderhabib.com). By the way, if you update or recreate this front with a new dist built folder, make sure to change the meta-title and site-icon from the index.html file inside the newly created dist folder. Cause, in react files, I didn't find that option. 

->E-commerce-next(Next + Laravel) is the next.js version of the frontend of this project. It's not as updated as the 'E-commerce-next(ReactVersion)'. Next.js 'build output' didn't work in the cpanel , plus it didn't work on the Vercel platform either. So, I was forced to shift to vanilla React.
