Project : Dental Site

Details: The transition from Local Version to the Cpanel Is quite simple. You need to make a zip version of the local Version that doesn't contain the .env file ( Cause the .env is local and we need .env file of the deployed version which is stored on the cpanel). And also , the Storage folder is also different between the local and deployed version as the images stored in them is dependent on user interection. The cpanel directory of this project has backup files in zip version in case anything goes wrong.
